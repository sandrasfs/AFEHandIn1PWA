# Credit Card Management System

## SWAFE 2024 – Hand in 1

## Introduction

We have been contacted by a new client who runs a consultant business. Each of their consultants has a company credit card, and they want to keep track of expenses for each credit card. They have drafted with a requirement specification for a credit card management system.

The solution will provide the accounting department with an overview of use for each credit card. Accountants can add new credit cards and remove them when after they have expired or is lost. It will also be possible to check transaction details for each credit card, as well as searching in transactions across all registered cards.
